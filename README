Yafaray 0.1.99-beta1 (2015-04-11) David Bluecame experimental exporter for Blender 2.74:
** THIS BUILD CONTAINS EXPERIMENTAL CHANGES AND FEATURES - DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION SCENES **

Unofficial build for Windows 7 and 8.1 (64 bits) by David Bluecame
Based on YafaRay git version + pull requests from David Bluecame not yet in master for
- New Clay Material
- Texture mapping of Sigma factor in Shiny Diffuse/Oren Nayar
- Fix for Negated colors in Musgrave/Voronoi textures mapped to diffuse color.

To install YafaRay to blender, copy this entire folder "yafaray" to the "C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.74\scripts\addons" folder.

After it, start Blender, go to User Preferences, AddOns and try to enable Render:YafaRay. Once (hopefully) enabled you should see it in the list of renderers.

This application is provided as is, and no guarantee is given that this code will preform in the desired way.

I hope this helps and you can start or continue to use this very nice and fast renderer!

Best regards. David.
