Yafaray 0.1.99-beta2 (2015-04-18) David Bluecame experimental exporter for Blender 2.74:
** THIS BUILD CONTAINS EXPERIMENTAL CHANGES AND FEATURES - DO NOT USE FOR PRODUCTION SCENES **

Unofficial build for XXXX (XX bits) by David Bluecame
Based on YafaRay git version + pull requests from David Bluecame not yet in master for
- New Clay Material, with a small correction since the previous beta1
- Texture mapping of Sigma factor in Shiny Diffuse/Oren Nayar

*WARNING* This beta2 includes an EXPERIMENTAL change to calculate automatically Shadow Bias and Minimum Ray Dist depending on the scene size. This is to avoid black artifacts when resizing the objects. However as it's a fundamental change that affects everything, perhaps some new artifacts could appear in the images now and further fine tuning needed in this new formula. Please give us feedback about it in the forum:
http://www.yafaray.org/community/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=5084 

To install YafaRay to blender, copy this entire folder "yafaray" to the "C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender\2.74\scripts\addons" folder.

After it, start Blender, go to User Preferences, AddOns and try to enable Render:YafaRay. Once (hopefully) enabled you should see it in the list of renderers.

This application is provided as is, and no guarantee is given that this code will preform in the desired way.

I hope this helps and you can start or continue to use this very nice and fast renderer!

Best regards. David.
