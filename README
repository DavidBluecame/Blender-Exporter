DESCRIPTION
-----------
YafaRay is a free open-source montecarlo raytracing engine released under the LGPL 2.1 license. Raytracing is a rendering technique for generating realistic images by tracing the path of light through a 3D scene. 

For more information, see: http://www.yafaray.org


YafaRay-E (Experimental) is an unofficial testing/unstable branch for fixes and new features, maintained by David Bluecame. Some of these fixes and features could be eventually accepted into the official/stable YafaRay, while others may end up rejected or implemented in a different way.

*WARNING*: YafaRay-E contains EXPERIMENTAL CHANGES AND FEATURES, so it's recommended not to use it for production scenes. This application is provided as is, and no guarantee is given that this code will preform in the desired way.
